## Theory

As usual, we will start with a few theoretical questions:

* [0.5] What is Docker, and how it differs from dependencies management systems? From virtual machines?
* [0.5] What are the advantages and disadvantages of using containers over other approaches?
* [0.5] Explain how Docker works: what are Dockerfiles, how are containers created, and how are they run and destroyed?
* [0.25] Name and describe at least one Docker competitor (i.e., a tool based on the same containerization technology).
* [0.25] What is conda? How it differs from apt, yarn, and others?

## Problem

**Anaconda**:

* [1] Install conda, create a new virtual environment, and install all necessary packages. 
* [0.75] You won't be able to install some tools - that's fine. List their names, and explain what should be done to make them conda-friendly ([conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html) channel, [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/contributor/workflow.html) channel). 
* [0.25] [Export](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#exporting-the-environment-yml-file) the environment ([example](https://github.com/nf-core/clipseq/blob/master/environment.yml)) to the file and verify that it can be [rebuilt](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) from the file without problems.

**Docker**:
* [3] Create a Dockerfile for a container with **all** required dependencies. Don't forget about comments; test that all tools are accessible and work inside the container. Hints:
 - If needed, grant rights to execute downloaded/compiled binaries using chmod (`chmod a+x BINARY_NAME`)
 - Move all executables to $PATH folders (e.g.`/usr/local/bin`) to make them accessible without specifying the full path.
 - Typical command to run a container interactively (`-it`) and delete on exit(`--rm`): `docker run --rm -it name:tag`
* [1] Use [hadolint](https://hadolint.github.io/hadolint/) and remove as many reported warnings as possible.
* [0.5] Add relevant [labels](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label), e.g. maintainer, version, etc. ([hint](https://medium.com/@chamilad/lets-make-your-docker-image-better-than-90-of-existing-ones-8b1e5de950d))
